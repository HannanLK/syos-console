## üìå Overview
SYOS replaces manual checkout and stock books with a single console app. It supports role-based access (Customer/Employee/Admin), separate POS and Web flows, PDF bills, and inventory pools with smart batch selection (FIFO with expiry override). It also demonstrates SOLID, Clean Architecture, and common design patterns.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Item Master with hierarchy (Brands, Categories, Suppliers)
- Batch tracking (manufacture/expiry), FIFO with expiry-date override
- Three inventory pools: WAREHOUSE_STOCK, SHELF_STOCK (POS), WEB_INVENTORY (Web)
- POS: cash tender, automatic change, sequential bill numbers, PDF + console bill
- Web: cart + session, card simulation (any 16 digits except 0767600730204128 fails), SYNEX points
- Stock transfers between pools; channel-specific availability
- Low‚Äëstock threshold (50) notifications and basic alerts
- Employee Personal Purchase mode: no discounts/price edits, LKR 10,000 limit, simple audit log
- Role-based access, BCrypt passwords, sessions
- Built-in reports: daily sales, channel sales, stock, inventory by location, reorder, bill report

## üß≠ Architecture
- Clean Architecture layers:
  - Domain: Entities (User, Product, Batch, Stock, Transaction), Value Objects (Money, ItemCode, Quantity, Email), Specifications, Domain Events
  - Application: Use cases (Auth, POS/Web, Inventory, Reporting), Strategies (FIFO/Expiry stock select, Payment), Services, Ports
  - Interface Adapters: CLI controllers/menus, presenters, repository adapters
  - Infrastructure: PostgreSQL + Hibernate, Security, Logging, PDF, Config
- Design Patterns in use (8‚Äì11): Observer, Strategy, Factory, Command, State, Singleton, Builder, Template Method, Proxy, Specification, Repository
- SOLID: SRP/ISP via focused use cases/ports, OCP/DIP via abstractions, clean naming and small methods

Inventory flow:
```
Supplier ‚Üí WAREHOUSE_STOCK ‚Üí {
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SHELF_STOCK (POS)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ WEB_INVENTORY (Web)
}
```
Batch selection: FIFO unless a newer batch expires sooner (expiry override)

## üß© Installation (Windows + PostgreSQL)
1. Prerequisites
   - Java 21+ (tested with 24), Maven 3.8+, PostgreSQL 12+
2. Open a terminal and change directory:
   - cd D:\\4th_final\\sem1\\clean_cod\\syos\\syos-console
3. Create database and roles (psql):
   - psql -U postgres -f "src\\main\\resources\\db\\migration\\database-setup.sql"
4. Run migrations in order (PowerShell):
   - Get-ChildItem "src\\main\\resources\\db\\migration\\V*.sql" | Sort-Object Name | ForEach-Object { psql -U postgres -d syosdb -f $_.FullName }
5. Build
   - mvn clean compile

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
- From IDE: run main class com.syos.Main
- Via Maven Exec:
  - mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.syos.Main" -DAPP_ENV=development
  - APP_ENV=development enables richer console logs

## üìé Assumptions
- Currency: LKR; no tax modeled
- Single‚Äëuser CLI (no concurrent sessions)
- Local PDF output; no external services
- Loyalty: 1% per 100 LKR; full payment only
- Employee personal purchase: LKR 10,000 limit; discounts disabled in that mode
- Soft deletes via status fields; timestamps and basic audits
