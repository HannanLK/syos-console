## Overview
SYOS replaces manual checkout and stock books with a single console application. It supports multi‚Äërole access (Customer/Employee/Admin), POS and Web transaction flows, batch tracking with FIFO and expiry override, separate inventory pools, loyalty points, and PDF bills ‚Äî all while demonstrating clean code and software design best practices.


## Features
- Item Master and product hierarchy (Brands, Categories, Suppliers)
- Batch tracking (mfg/expiry), FIFO with expiry-date override
- Three inventory pools: WAREHOUSE_STOCK, SHELF_STOCK (POS), WEB_INVENTORY (Web)
- POS flow with cash tender and automatic change, sequential bills (PDF + console)
- Web flow with cart, card simulation (fails only for 0767600730204128), and SYNEX points
- Stock transfers between pools; separate availability per channel
- Low‚Äëstock threshold (50) and basic notifications
- Employee personal purchase mode (basic): no discounts/price edits, LKR 10,000 limit, simple audit log
- Role‚Äëbased access control with BCrypt passwords and session management
- Standard reports (daily sales, channel sales, stock, inventory by location, reorder, bill report)


## Tech Stack
- Language/Build: Java 24, Maven 3.8+
- Database/ORM: PostgreSQL 12+, Hibernate ORM (JPA 3.2), HikariCP
- Security/Validation: jBCrypt, Jakarta Validation (Hibernate Validator)
- Logging: SLF4J + Logback
- PDF/Utilities: Apache PDFBox, Apache Commons (Lang, CSV), Lombok
- Testing/Quality: JUnit 5, Mockito, Testcontainers (PostgreSQL), JaCoCo


## Architecture (Clean Architecture + Patterns + SOLID)
- Layers
  - Domain: Entities (User, Product, Batch, Stock, Transaction), Value Objects (Money, ItemCode, Quantity, Email), Specifications, Domain Events
  - Application: Use cases (Auth, POS/Web billing, Inventory, Reporting), Strategies (stock selection FIFO/expiry, payments), Services (Discounts, EventBus), Ports
  - Interface Adapters: CLI controllers/menus, presenters, repository adapters
  - Infrastructure: JPA/Hibernate, PostgreSQL, security, logging, PDF, configuration
- Design Patterns (11)
  - Observer, Strategy, Factory, Command, State, Singleton, Builder, Template Method, Proxy, Specification, Repository
- SOLID and Clean Code
  - SRP/ISP: Use cases and ports are small and specific
  - OCP/DIP: New strategies or persistence adapters plug via interfaces
  - Clean code: meaningful names, small methods, defensive validation


## Installation (Windows/psql)
1) Prerequisites
   - Java 21+ (built with 24), Maven 3.8+, PostgreSQL 12+
2) Clone
   - cd D:\4th_final\sem1\clean_cod\syos\syos-console
3) Create database (psql)
   - psql -U postgres -f "src\main\resources\db\migration\database-setup.sql"
4) Run migrations (in order)
   - PowerShell one‚Äëliner:
     - Get-ChildItem "src\main\resources\db\migration\V*.sql" | Sort-Object Name | ForEach-Object { psql -U postgres -d syosdb -f $_.FullName }
   - Or run key scripts manually (V1 ‚Ä¶ V11) from the same folder
5) Build
   - mvn clean compile


## Test Users
On first start the app ensures default users exist.
- admin / admin12345 ‚Äî ADMIN
- employee / employee123 ‚Äî EMPLOYEE
- customer / customer123 ‚Äî CUSTOMER


## How to Run
- Option A (from IDE): Run com.syos.Main
- Option B (Maven Exec): mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.syos.Main" -DAPP_ENV=development
  - APP_ENV=development enables richer console logs; omit for production‚Äëlike output


## Reports (built-in)
- Daily Sales: totals, items, qty, revenue (by day, by channel)
- Channel Sales: POS vs Web comparison
- Stock Report: batch‚Äëwise with mfg/expiry
- Inventory Location: warehouse/shelf/web levels
- Reorder: items below 50
- Bill Report: all bills with channel identification


## Assumptions
- Currency: LKR; taxes not modeled
- Single‚Äëuser CLI (no concurrent sessions)
- PDF files stored locally; no external services
- Loyalty: 1% per 100 LKR spent; no partial payments
- Employee personal purchase: LKR 10,000 limit; discounts disabled in that mode
- Soft deletes via status fields where applicable; audit timestamps recorded
