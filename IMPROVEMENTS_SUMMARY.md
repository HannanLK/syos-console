## Technical Implementation Details

### Time-Based Greeting Logic
```java
LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();
int hour = now.getHour();
String greeting;
if (hour < 12) {
    greeting = "Good Morning";
} else if (hour < 17) {
    greeting = "Good Afternoon"; 
} else {
    greeting = "Good Evening";
}
```

### User Profile Display
- Formatted member since date: "MMMM dd, yyyy" format
- Professional border styling using Unicode box characters
- Consistent padding for text alignment
- Displays key user information: Username, Email, Synex Points, Member Since

### Session Management Integration
- Automatic session creation after registration
- Proper session management through SessionManager singleton
- Clean navigation stack management
- Role-based menu redirection

## Files Modified

1. **MenuFactory.java** - Removed debug info, streamlined customer menu
2. **RegisterCommand.java** - Added auto-login, user profile display
3. **LoginCommand.java** - Enhanced login header, user profile display

## Assumptions Made

1. **User Experience Priority**: Assumed smooth user flow is more important than explicit confirmation steps
2. **Profile Information Display**: Assumed users want to see their profile information immediately after login rather than navigating to separate menus
3. **Menu Simplification**: Assumed core navigation functions (Browse, Cart, History, Logout) are sufficient for customer menu
4. **Time-Based Greeting**: Assumed users appreciate personalized greetings based on current time
5. **Member Since Date**: Used registration date as member since date for new users

## Design Patterns Maintained

1. **Command Pattern**: All user actions implemented as commands
2. **Factory Pattern**: Menu creation through MenuFactory
3. **Singleton Pattern**: SessionManager for session management
4. **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns maintained

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved User Experience**: Seamless registration-to-usage flow
2. **Reduced Friction**: Eliminated redundant login step after registration
3. **Better Information Display**: Professional user profile formatting
4. **Cleaner Navigation**: Streamlined menus focused on core functions
5. **Enhanced Personalization**: Time-based greetings for better user engagement

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test registration flow end-to-end
2. Verify time-based greetings at different hours
3. Confirm session management works correctly
4. Test menu navigation after auto-login
5. Verify user profile information displays correctly
6. Test error handling during registration failures

## Future Enhancements

1. Add user avatar/profile picture support
2. Implement user preference settings
3. Add notification system for user alerts
4. Enhance member benefits based on membership duration
5. Add user activity tracking and last login information
